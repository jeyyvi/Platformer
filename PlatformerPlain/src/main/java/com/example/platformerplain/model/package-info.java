/**
 * Provides model classes for the elements and characters of the game.
 * <p>
 *     This com.example.platformerplain.model package includes classes that
 *     represent the different elements and characters in the game, such as
 *     the player, enemies.
 *     <br><br>
 *     This package implements the MVC design pattern by separating the code
 *     from the View and Controller.
 *     This design pattern makes the code easy to be developed and maintained even if there are new characters and
 *     features to be added into the game.
